# Supervised Learning Assignment - Giovanni Peralto
Code was written in Python 3.x. Python/pip is needed to run the program.

### Instructions:

Install dependencies: 
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install time`

Create images directories:
- `mkdir images`
- `mkdir images/decision-tree`
- `mkdir images/neural-network`
- `mkdir images/adaboost`
- `mkdir images/svm`
- `mkdir images/knn`

Run instructions:
- Decision Trees: `python decision_tree.py`
- Neural Networks: `python neural_network.py` (takes a while)
- Boosting: `python adaboost.py`
- Support Vector Machines: `python svm.py`
- k-Nearest Neigbors: `python knn.py`
